{"name":"Tristan S Yates","tagline":"","body":"### Hello! About Me\r\n\r\nI am a PhD student at Yale University, where I work primarily with Dr. Nick Turk-Browne. The bulk of my work is interested in how babies experience the world: how they segment continuous experience into discrete events, recognize individual faces in their environment, acquire structured knowledge or schemas, remember objects or experiences. I use fMRI with awake behaving infants in order to better understand infants' representations and the neural structures that support these processes. In several projects, I apply principles of computational neuroscience to better understand the developing mind and brain. \r\n\r\nOutside of the lab, I can be found at the climbing gym, on a yoga mat, with my border collie, drinking red wine, or playing board games.\r\n\r\nContact me here: tristan.yates@yale.edu\r\n\r\n### Papers\r\n**Yates, T.
